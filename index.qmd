## Nice to meet you!

My name is Reiko and I'm a creative implementer passionate about reproducible data analysis. I find a lot of joy in making sense of complex clinical and administrative data, helping collaborators transform their research questions into insights through code. 

I'm also active within the R-Ladies community. As an [R-Ladies Ottawa](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ottawa/) co-organizer, I put on events that make coding more accessible and create opportunities for data enthusiasts to connect over their shared passion. As an administrator of the [We Are R-Ladies Bluesky account](https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org), I manage a rotating curation program where each week a different member of the R community takes over the account to share their insights and discuss their work.

When I'm not at my computer, you'll probably find me travelling, trainspotting, or training to be on the next season of *The Amazing Race Canada*.
