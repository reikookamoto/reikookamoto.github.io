## Summary

As a member of the R-Ladies Ottawa chapter, I developed and led a series of virtual workshops aimed at introducing novice programmers to R and popular packages in the tidyverse. These sessions attracted participants not only from Ottawa but also from around the world. With the help of R-Ladies Global, we were able to test drive their Posit Cloud space, eliminating the need for participants to configure dedicated hardware or install software on their local machines.
