## Summary

Each week, a different R-Lady takes over the [\@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) Twitter account to share their experiences using R. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a wide range of experiences in R.

From October 17 to October 22, 2022, I tweeted about how to develop packages, ensure code reproducibility, and organize coding workshops. My tweet about writing ggplot2 extensions was particularly well received and received over 400 likes!

(1/n) A fun and practical idea for an R package: a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ggplot2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ggplot2</a> extension to modify plots so they adhere to an organization's visual identity 📊📈📉⬇️
