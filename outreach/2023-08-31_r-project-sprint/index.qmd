## Summary

I participated in the R Project Sprint hosted at the University of Warwick, UK, from August 30 to September 1, 2023. I had the pleasure of being one of 46 participants to work alongside members of the R Core Team and collaboratively make contributions to base R. This involved tasks like fixing bugs and improving documentation. It was a wonderful opportunity to experience and appreciate the extensive coordination that is required to maintain open-source software. Personally, I had a great time assisting with the English-to-Japanese translation of messages (e.g., errors, warnings) while hearing about the experiences of others who use and teach R in non-English environments.
