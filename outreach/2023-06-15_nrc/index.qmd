## Summary

As part of the Women in Science and Innovation peer group at National Research Council Canada (NRC), I noticed that there was a strong interest in an introductory R programming course. Alongside my colleagues, Jenna Mackinnon and Solenn Mordret, I co-organized a four-part virtual workshop covering the fundamentals and data wrangling and visualization using popular R packages like dplyr and ggplot2. Our priority was to create a welcoming environment, assisting participants with software installation and providing communication in both official languages.

With over 50 women participating from various cities and research centers across Canada, our initiative garnered recognition from NRC executives. As a result, my co-organizers and I were invited to participate in a panel discussion focused on coding at the [Celebrating the Success of Women in STEM Symposium](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/corporate/events/welcome-2024-celebrating-success-women-stem-symposium), held on February 9, 2024.
