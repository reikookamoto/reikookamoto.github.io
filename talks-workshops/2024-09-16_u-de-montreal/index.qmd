## Summary

I was invited by Professor Vincent Arel-Bundock as a guest lecturer to lead a 
three-hour workshop for the *FAS 3001 - Statistiques avancées en sciences 
sociales* course. The workshop focused on data wrangling with dplyr and 
visualization with ggplot2. I also shared insights into my non-linear career 
trajectory and discussed how I use R at the research institute.
