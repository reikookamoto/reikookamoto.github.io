## About the conference

[useR! 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/) took place in Salzburg, 
Austria from July 8 to 11, 2024. The conference's 20th anniversary brought 
together R users from around the world, featuring presentations that showcased 
the latest advancements and applications of the programming language. I was 
honoured to have my submission selected for a five-minute lightning talk.

## What I presented

*This abstract has been edited for conciseness*

Summary tables are common in scientific manuscripts reporting epidemiological 
studies. Table 1 typically displays key demographic information about the study 
population while Table 2 often presents associations between explanatory and 
outcome variables. Given the variety of ways to create these tables in R (some 
more robust than others), our research group developed a reproducible workflow 
suitable for colleagues with varying levels of R proficiency. 

In this talk, I will discuss the landscape of table-generating packages, present 
our solution, and explain how we overcame challenges like incorporating existing 
metadata. These strategies are not only valuable for epidemiologists but also 
for researchers in other health and social sciences.
