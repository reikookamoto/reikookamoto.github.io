## Summary

As a member of the Women in Science and Innovation peer group at National 
Research Council Canada (NRC), I noticed a strong interest in an introductory R 
course. Together with my colleagues, [Jenna Mackinnon](https://github.com/yoitsjenna) 
and Solenn Mordret, I co-organized a four-part virtual workshop covering the 
fundamentals of base R as well as data wrangling and visualization using popular 
packages like dplyr and ggplot2. Our priority was to create a welcoming 
environment, assisting participants with software installation and providing 
communication in both official languages.

With over 50 women participating from various cities and research centers across 
Canada, our initiative garnered recognition from NRC executives. As a result, my 
co-organizers and I were invited to participate in a panel discussion focused on 
coding at the *[Celebrating the Success of Women in STEM Symposium](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/corporate/events/welcome-2024-celebrating-success-women-stem-symposium)*
held on February 9, 2024.
