## Summary

As a member of R-Ladies Ottawa, I developed and led a series of virtual 
workshops aimed at introducing novice programmers to base R and popular 
tidyverse packages. These sessions attracted participants not only from Ottawa 
but also from around the world. 

With the generous support of the R-Ladies Global team, we were able to test 
drive their Posit Cloud environment, which eliminated the need for participants 
to install software on their local machines. This significantly lowered the 
barrier to entry, allowing participants to focus on learning without the 
technical hurdles of software installation.
