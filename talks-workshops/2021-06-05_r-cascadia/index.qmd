## About the conference

[Cascadia R](https://cascadiarconf.com/) is a regional R conference serving the 
Pacific Northwest. In 2021, the event took place online on June 4 and 5. I had 
the opportunity to reflect on my experience at the Office of the Provincial 
Health Officer in British Columbia through a five-minute lightning talk.

## What I presented

*This abstract has been edited for conciseness*

Restructuring frequently used code snippets into well-organized internal 
packages is easier said than done. In this presentation, we discuss how to 
address challenges that are less explored compared to the technical aspects of 
the development process. How do you find out what your team truly needs? And 
once the package is complete, how do you encourage colleagues to adopt it? 

We answer these questions through a case study reflecting on our team's 
experience creating a ggplot2 extension to match the organization's existing 
style guide for healthcare utilization reports. This package streamlines plot 
formatting, allowing analysts to focus on identifying trends in the data to 
share with technical writers, thereby fostering more efficient collaboration 
between the two groups.
