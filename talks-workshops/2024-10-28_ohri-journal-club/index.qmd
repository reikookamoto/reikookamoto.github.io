## Summary

I developed and led a series of virtual workshops designed to introduce novice 
programmers to popular R packages such as dplyr and ggplot2. The sessions 
attracted over 50 participants, including attendees from the Ottawa Hospital 
Research Institute and other academic organizations in the city.
