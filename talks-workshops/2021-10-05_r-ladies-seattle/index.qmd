## Summary 

I was invited by R-Ladies Seattle after delivering a similar session to the 
Vancouver chapter.

In this 2-hour virtual workshop, participants developed a simple R package to 
gain hands-on experience, following best practices 
outlined in [*R Packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer 
Bryan. 

In addition to covering the technical aspects of package development (e.g., 
structuring, documenting, and testing code), I shared insights from my 
experience developing an R package for the Office of the Provincial Health 
Officer in British Columbia. This included strategies for aligning features with 
the needs of a team and encouraging package adoption within an organization.

Participants left the workshop with both practical skills for creating R 
packages and actionable tips for fostering collaboration in professional 
settings.
