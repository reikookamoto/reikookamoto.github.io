## About the conference

posit::conf(2023) took place in Chicago, USA from September 17 to 20, 2023. As 
one of the largest conferences in the R community, this event offers a unique 
opportunity to learn about new tools and foster connections within the 
open-source community. The event featured a diverse program, including workshops 
keynotes, and presentations.

I had the privilege of attending as both a speaker and an Opportunity Scholar. 
During the conference, I had the chance to connect with fellow Opportunity 
Scholarship recipients and members of the R-Ladies community from around the 
world.

## What I presented

*This abstract has been edited for conciseness*

Ideas from home organization shows are surprisingly applicable to file 
management. Using a room divider in a studio to establish dedicated zones 
for different activities is analogous to creating self-contained projects. 
Likewise, swapping mismatched hangers with matching ones resembles the adoption 
of a file naming convention to make a directory easier to navigate.

In this talk, I will share good practices in file management through the lens of 
home organization. We all know that clutter, whether it is in our physical space 
or on our machine, impacts our ability to focus. These practices will help useRs 
create a serene, relaxing environment where they feel inspired to work with data.
