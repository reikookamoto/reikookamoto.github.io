## Summary

Each week, a different useR took over the [\@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) 
Twitter account to share their experiences using R. Featured curators came from 
a wide range of professions and had a wide variety of experience in R. The 
program has since left Twitter and moved to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org).

From October 17 to October 22, 2022, I tweeted about how to develop packages, 
ensure code reproducibility, and organize coding workshops. My tweet about 
writing ggplot2 extensions was particularly well received, garnering hundreds of 
likes!
