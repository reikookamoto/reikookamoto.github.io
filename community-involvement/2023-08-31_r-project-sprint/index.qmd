## Summary

The R Project Sprint took place at the University of Warwick from August 30 to 
September 1, 2023. It brought together 46 participants, including members of the 
R Core team, to collaboratively contribute to base R. This included tasks such 
as fixing bugs, improving documentation, and working on message translations 
(i.e., internationalization).

During the event, I focused on assisting with the English-to-Japanese 
translation of messages in base R and packages supplied with the R distribution. 
The event offered me a valuable opportunity to learn from useRs who teach coding 
in non-English environments and deepened my appreciation for the extensive 
coordination required to maintain open-source software.
