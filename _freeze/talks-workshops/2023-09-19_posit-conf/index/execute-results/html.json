As \none of the largest conferences in the R community, this event offers a unique \nopportunity to learn about new tools and foster connections within the \nopen-source community. The event featured a diverse program, including workshops \nkeynotes, and presentations.\n\nI had the privilege of attending as both a speaker and an Opportunity Scholar. \nDuring the conference, I had the chance to connect with fellow Opportunity \nScholarship recipients and members of the R-Ladies community from around the \nworld.\n\n## What I presented\n\n*This abstract has been edited for conciseness*\n\nIdeas from home organization shows are surprisingly applicable to file \nmanagement. Using a room divider in a studio to establish dedicated zones \nfor different activities is analogous to creating self-contained projects. \nLikewise, swapping mismatched hangers with matching ones resembles the adoption \nof a file naming convention to make a directory easier to navigate.\n\nIn this talk, I will share good practices in file management through the lens of \nhome organization. We all know that clutter, whether it is in our physical space \nor on our machine, impacts our ability to focus. These practices will help useRs \ncreate a serene, relaxing environment where they feel inspired to work with data.\n",
