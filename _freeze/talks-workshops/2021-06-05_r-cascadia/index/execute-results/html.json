In 2021, the event took place online on June 4 and 5. I had \nthe opportunity to reflect on my experience at the Office of the Provincial \nHealth Officer in British Columbia through a five-minute lightning talk.\n\n## What I presented\n\n*This abstract has been edited for conciseness*\n\nRestructuring frequently used code snippets into well-organized internal \npackages is easier said than done. In this presentation, we discuss how to \naddress challenges that are less explored compared to the technical aspects of \nthe development process. How do you find out what your team truly needs? And \nonce the package is complete, how do you encourage colleagues to adopt it? \n\nWe answer these questions through a case study reflecting on our team's \nexperience creating a ggplot2 extension to match the organization's existing \nstyle guide for healthcare utilization reports. This package streamlines plot \nformatting, allowing analysts to focus on identifying trends in the data to \nshare with technical writers, thereby fostering more efficient collaboration \nbetween the two groups. \n",
