The conference's 20th anniversary brought \ntogether R users from around the world, featuring presentations that showcased \nthe latest advancements and applications of the programming language. I was \nhonoured to have my submission selected for a five-minute lightning talk.\n\n## What I presented\n\n*This abstract has been edited for conciseness*\n\nSummary tables are common in scientific manuscripts reporting epidemiological \nstudies. Table 1 typically displays key demographic information about the study \npopulation while Table 2 often presents associations between explanatory and \noutcome variables. Given the variety of ways to create these tables in R (some \nmore robust than others), our research group developed a reproducible workflow \nsuitable for colleagues with varying levels of R proficiency. \n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the landscape of table-generating packages, present \nour solution, and explain how we overcame challenges like incorporating existing \nmetadata. These strategies are not only valuable for epidemiologists but also \nfor researchers in other health and social sciences.\n",
