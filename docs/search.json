These sessions attracted participants not only from Ottawa but also from around the world.\nWith the generous support of the R-Ladies Global team, we were able to test drive their Posit Cloud environment, which eliminated the need for participants to install software on their local machines. This significantly lowered the barrier to entry, allowing participants to focus on learning without the technical hurdles of software installation."

Together with my colleagues, Jenna Mackinnon and Solenn Mordret, I co-organized a four-part virtual workshop covering the fundamentals of base R as well as data wrangling and visualization using popular packages like dplyr and ggplot2. Our priority was to create a welcoming environment, assisting participants with software installation and providing communication in both official languages.\nWith over 50 women participating from various cities and research centers across Canada, our initiative garnered recognition from NRC executives. As a result, my co-organizers and I were invited to participate in a panel discussion focused on coding at the Celebrating the Success of Women in STEM Symposium held on February 9, 2024."

In this presentation, we discuss how to address challenges that are less explored compared to the technical aspects of the development process. How do you find out what your team truly needs? And once the package is complete, how do you encourage colleagues to adopt it?\nWe answer these questions through a case study reflecting on our team’s experience creating a ggplot2 extension to match the organization’s existing style guide for healthcare utilization reports. This package streamlines plot formatting, allowing analysts to focus on identifying trends in the data to share with technical writers, thereby fostering more efficient collaboration between the two groups."

It brought together 46 participants, including members of the R Core team, to collaboratively contribute to base R. This included tasks such as fixing bugs, improving documentation, and working on message translations (i.e., internationalization).\nDuring the event, I focused on assisting with the English-to-Japanese translation of messages in base R and packages supplied with the R distribution. The event offered me a valuable opportunity to learn from useRs who teach coding in non-English environments and deepened my appreciation for the extensive coordination required to maintain open-source software.\nFor more insights, check out this excellent blog post by Shannon Pileggi."

Using a room divider in a studio to establish dedicated zones for different activities is analogous to creating self-contained projects. Likewise, swapping mismatched hangers with matching ones resembles the adoption of a file naming convention to make a directory easier to navigate.\nIn this talk, I will share good practices in file management through the lens of home organization. We all know that clutter, whether it is in our physical space or on our machine, impacts our ability to focus. These practices will help useRs create a serene, relaxing environment where they feel inspired to work with data."

Table 1 typically displays key demographic information about the study population while Table 2 often presents associations between explanatory and outcome variables. Given the variety of ways to create these tables in R (some more robust than others), our research group developed a reproducible workflow suitable for colleagues with varying levels of R proficiency.\nIn this talk, I will discuss the landscape of table-generating packages, present our solution, and explain how we overcame challenges like incorporating existing metadata. These strategies are not only valuable for epidemiologists but also for researchers in other health and social sciences."
