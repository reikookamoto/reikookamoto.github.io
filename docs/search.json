Since there are endless ways (some more robust than others) to create analytical and summary tables in R, our research group wanted to define a workflow that could be adopted by colleagues of varying levels of proficiency in R to reproducibly create these tables from raw data. In this talk, I will share our approach in designing this workflow and what we discovered along the way. This will include a discussion on the current landscape of table-generating packages in R and how we overcame the limitations of existing software alongside other challenges (e.g., incorporating existing metadata). These strategies will not only be useful to researchers in epidemiology but also relevant for those in other health and social science disciplines."

    "text": "Abstract\nIdeas from home organization shows are surprisingly applicable to file management. Using a room divider to establish dedicated zones for different activities in a studio apartment is analogous to creating self-contained projects in RStudio. Likewise, swapping mismatched hangers with matching ones to tidy a closet resembles the adoption of a file naming convention to make a directory easier to navigate.\nIn this talk, I will share good practices in file management through the lens of home organization. We all know that clutter, whether it is in our physical space or on our machine, destroys our ability to focus. These practices will help R users of all levels create a serene, relaxing environment where they feel inspired to work with data."

Alongside my colleagues, Jenna Mackinnon and Solenn Mordret, I co-organized a four-part virtual workshop covering the fundamentals and data wrangling and visualization using popular R packages like dplyr and ggplot2. Our priority was to create a welcoming environment, assisting participants with software installation and providing communication in both official languages.\nWith over 50 women participating from various cities and research centers across Canada, our initiative garnered recognition from NRC executives. As a result, my co-organizers and I were invited to participate in a panel discussion focused on coding at the Celebrating the Success of Women in STEM Symposium, held on February 9, 2024."

Not only do they provide an excellent framework for organizing your code, but they also make it easier to share code with other R users. In this virtual workshop, we will develop a simple R package to gain an understanding of the development process. I will also reflect on my experiences creating an internal package on behalf of my colleagues at the BC Ministry of Health. I hope to shed light on the lesser-known non-technical aspects of package development by discussing how to identify what tools your teammates need to succeed and how to encourage them to adopt your package. This workshop is geared towards (but not limited to) those who are new to developing packages and those who are considering creating one to share within their organization and beyond."

    "text": "Abstract\nRestructuring frequently used code snippets into well-organized internal packages is easier said than done. In this presentation, we share useful tools for package development and our approach to planning a package before writing the first line of code. We will discuss how to overcome challenges in this pre-coding phase, which is not as well documented as the technical aspects of the package development process. How do you find out what is it exactly that your team needs? How do you encourage team members to adopt the package and spread R culture? We answer these questions through a case study reflecting on our team’s experience creating a ggplot2 extension to meet the organization’s style guide for healthcare utilization reports. This package allows our analysts to focus on identifying trends in the data to share with the writing team instead of modifying their plots to get their look and feel right each time. Furthermore, this package has fostered an environment of collaboration by acting as a bridge between the analysts and technical writers in our organization."

This involved tasks like fixing bugs and improving documentation. It was a wonderful opportunity to experience and appreciate the extensive coordination that is required to maintain open-source software. Personally, I had a great time assisting with the English-to-Japanese translation of messages (e.g., errors, warnings) while hearing about the experiences of others who use and teach R in non-English environments."
