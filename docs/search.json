Not only do they provide an excellent framework for organizing your code, but they also make it easier to share code with other R users. In this virtual workshop, we will develop a simple R package to gain an understanding of the development process. I will also reflect on my experiences creating an internal package on behalf of my colleagues at the BC Ministry of Health. I hope to shed light on the lesser-known non-technical aspects of package development by discussing how to identify what tools your teammates need to succeed and how to encourage them to adopt your package. This workshop is geared towards (but not limited to) those who are new to developing packages and those who are considering creating one to share within their organization and beyond."

    "text": "Abstract\nRestructuring frequently used code snippets into well-organized internal packages is easier said than done. In this presentation, we share useful tools for package development and our approach to planning a package before writing the first line of code. We will discuss how to overcome challenges in this pre-coding phase, which is not as well documented as the technical aspects of the package development process. How do you find out what is it exactly that your team needs? How do you encourage team members to adopt the package and spread R culture? We answer these questions through a case study reflecting on our team‚Äôs experience creating a ggplot2 extension to meet the organization‚Äôs style guide for healthcare utilization reports. This package allows our analysts to focus on identifying trends in the data to share with the writing team instead of modifying their plots to get their look and feel right each time. Furthermore, this package has fostered an environment of collaboration by acting as a bridge between the analysts and technical writers in our organization."
