In this presentation, we share useful tools for package development and our approach to planning a package before writing the first line of code. We will discuss how to overcome challenges in this pre-coding phase, which is not as well documented as the technical aspects of the package development process. How do you find out what is it exactly that your team needs? How do you encourage team members to adopt the package and spread R culture? We answer these questions through a case study reflecting on our team‚Äôs experience creating a ggplot2 extension to meet the organization‚Äôs style guide for healthcare utilization reports. This package allows our analysts to focus on identifying trends in the data to share with the writing team instead of modifying their plots to get their look and feel right each time. Furthermore, this package has fostered an environment of collaboration by acting as a bridge between the analysts and technical writers in our organization."

This involved tasks like fixing bugs and improving documentation. It was a wonderful opportunity to experience and appreciate the extensive coordination that is required to maintain open-source software. Personally, I had a great time assisting with the English-to-Japanese translation of messages (e.g., errors, warnings) while hearing about the experiences of others who use and teach R in non-English environments."

Using a room divider to establish dedicated zones for different activities in a studio apartment is analogous to creating self-contained projects in RStudio. Likewise, swapping mismatched hangers with matching ones to tidy a closet resembles the adoption of a file naming convention to make a directory easier to navigate.\nIn this talk, I will share good practices in file management through the lens of home organization. We all know that clutter, whether it is in our physical space or on our machine, destroys our ability to focus. These practices will help R users of all levels create a serene, relaxing environment where they feel inspired to work with data."

Our priority was to create a welcoming environment, assisting participants with software installation and providing communication in both official languages.\nWith over 50 women participating from various cities and research centers across Canada, our initiative garnered recognition from NRC executives. As a result, my co-organizers and I were invited to participate in a panel discussion focused on coding at the Celebrating the Success of Women in STEM Symposium, held on February 9, 2024."
